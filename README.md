# Sprint review form
I am working on coding bootcamp now. During my work, I need to get feedbacks of each sprint from students. So I have thought of the way to get answers from them that is not cumbersome for me and them.
After sprint ends, students create pull request to original repo to submit their code, so I found a way that create an markdown file that students can fill answers for questions and a code get answers from the file when students submit their code.
When students submit their work, the code that takes the answers from the markdown file runs on circleci and sends answers to spread sheet automaticaly.
